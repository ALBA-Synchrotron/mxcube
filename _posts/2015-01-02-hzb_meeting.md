During two sunny days in Berlin we all met to discuss about
ongoing work in our collaboration and to establish a roadmap
for the future.

### Highlights

* A Qt4 version of MXCuBE is in the pipe, thanks to the work
of Ivars Karpics at EMBL Hamburg
* A kick-off meeting will be organised between MAX-lab and
ESRF in September to start the work on MXCuBE 3, that will
result in a web application
* EDNA becomes part of MXCuBE
* A MXCuBE 2 paper is in preparation

### Next meeting will happen in ALBA in Barcelona in November

## See you soon !
